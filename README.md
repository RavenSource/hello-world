# hello-world
First Github Respository - will be used for fun experimentation activities separate from my formal projects

Greetings!!!

I  have been programming off and on for over 35 years.  I remember my first programs in BASIC written on a RadioShack TSR-80 MC-10 with only 4k ram and recorded on a special cassette recorder.  I was so psyched when I got the 16k ram expansion module for Christmas.

Since then I have learned many different languages and created many different applications and websites.

For the first time, I am looking to put my Comp Science degree to use and start programming professionally.  I am looking forward to the new adventure.
